# DecayGenerator
A small project to generate double beta decays (with and without neutrinos). Return energies and angles between electrons in the decay. 

## Installation 
The following projects are required for successfull compilation:
* GSL (GNU Scientific Library)
* Boost with components:
   * python3
   * system
   * numpy-py3
* PythonLibs 
* Python with component NumPy

In order to compile it do: 
~~~~
> cmake 
> make 
~~~~
This sohuld produce "lib" folder with libDecayGenerator.so

## Usage in python
